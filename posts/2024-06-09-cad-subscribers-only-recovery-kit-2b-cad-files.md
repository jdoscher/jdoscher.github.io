<p>Hi CAD members!  Thank you so much for your support on my projects.  You have been instrumental in helping provide support in these last few months.  You can find the file that contains the CAD files for both the Recovery Kit 2, as well as the most recent Recovery Kit 2B.  Remember, these are for non-commercial use only, but are released under Creative Commons!  That means you are free to share your modified versions with the larger community- I just ask that you link back here, preserve my parts links for Amazon (I earn a commission on those), and that you post lots of photos of your builds.  If you're interested in licensing commercially, just reach out to me at jay@doscher.com and we can come up with flexible terms.  Thank you and happy printing!</p><div class="kg-card kg-file-card"><a class="kg-file-card-container" href="__GHOST_URL__/content/files/2024/06/doscher.com-Recovery-Kit-Version-Two-and-Two-B-CAD-and-STL-Files.zip" title="Download" download=""><div class="kg-file-card-contents"><div class="kg-file-card-title">doscher.com Recovery Kit Version Two and Two B CAD and STL Files</div><div class="kg-file-card-caption"></div><div class="kg-file-card-metadata"><div class="kg-file-card-filename">doscher.com Recovery Kit Version Two and Two B CAD and STL Files.zip</div><div class="kg-file-card-filesize">13 MB</div></div></div><div class="kg-file-card-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24"><defs><style>.a{fill:none;stroke:currentColor;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-width:1.5px;}</style></defs><title>download-circle</title><polyline class="a" points="8.25 14.25 12 18 15.75 14.25"></polyline><line class="a" x1="12" y1="6.75" x2="12" y2="18"></line><circle class="a" cx="12" cy="12" r="11.25"></circle></svg></div></a></div>
