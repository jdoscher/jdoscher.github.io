<p>I'm excited to share with you a new commercial offering - the Air Kit 25.  The Air Kit has a simple premise- the existing cases out there are either too small for some gear, or way too big.  The Air Kit 25 fits in the middle with 8U of storage and a 9" maximum depth for equipment.</p><p>As always, no modification is needed for the Pelican 1607 case, which has the soft-touch locks, roller wheels, and extending handle.  This means you can travel with rackmount gear and be free from worry about outside dust and water with the case closed.</p><p>The kit comes both fully assembled, as well as just the frame alone.  Assembly only takes a few minutes, and uses M5 screws included to put it together.  Orders are now available on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/4334329456/rugged-8u-rackmount-travel-case-air-kit" rel="noreferrer"><strong>my store here</strong></a>, with bulk discounts and customization available- just reach out.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03812-2.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="/images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03812-2.jpeg 600w, /images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03812-2.jpeg 1000w, /images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03812-2.jpeg 1600w, /images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03812-2.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03809-1.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="/images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03809-1.jpeg 600w, /images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03809-1.jpeg 1000w, /images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03809-1.jpeg 1600w, /images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03809-1.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03810-1.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="/images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03810-1.jpeg 600w, /images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03810-1.jpeg 1000w, /images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03810-1.jpeg 1600w, /images/content/images/2025/07/DSC03810-1.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>
