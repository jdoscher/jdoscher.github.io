<p>Happy Saturday, Patrons!  First, thank you for your support!  I am pleased to share that test prints are complete for the 2024 lineup of Quick Kit variants.  In case you're new to the lineup, the Recovery Kit is the original deck that fits in a Pelican 1300 case.  The Quick Kit was devised to be easier to print with easy-to-assemble parts.  While the Recovery Kit takes almost 100 hours to print, assemble, and wire, the Quick Kits can usually be assembled in minutes.</p><p>All paid subscribers enrolled with an annual membership will be getting the designs for all the Quick Kits, as well as a physical print of one of the frames of their choosing.  I'll be reaching out directly to you in October to arrange for shipment, as well as to share the designs with you directly.</p><p>Without any further delay, here's a peek at the lineup:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/2024-Lineup.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="739" height="814" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/2024-Lineup.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/2024-Lineup.jpg 739w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You'll notice some have vents, some do not- the names of each will be released in October when the store goes live, which is designed for people who don't have a printer or simply don't subscribe.  My only ask is that while I love modifications, please- PLEASE don't share the designs unmodified on printing websites.  The designs will be released as non-commercial, so if you want to license for a commercial purpose just let me know and we can work something out.</p><p>I have also started prototyping on a new Recovery Kit, and while it will be open for commission and have the designs open source, it will be quite expensive to build.  In order to top the 2019 Recovery Kit it's going to take some interesting approaches, and it means some big and complex parts.  Here's an example of the carbon fiber test print to get the display chassis started:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/JAY00105.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/JAY00105.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/09/JAY00105.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>There's some very rough prints in there, but there's great progress.  If all goes well I think this may drop in 2023, but we will see.</p><p>Thank you again, Patrons!  If you're looking forward to a free frame in October, leave a comment to let me know what you plan to use it for!  </p>
