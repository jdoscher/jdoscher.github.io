<p>Hi Subscribers!  Thanks for taking time to take a quick rewind at one of my earliest projects shared online.  This is a subscriber-only post, which means only people signed up for email subscriptions or a paid tier can see this post.  Going forward, the new projects will have even more detail including code snippets, drawings, and detailed notes. </p><p>Anyway, to say thank you to my email subscribers, here's some additional photos and build logs for the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/work-lora-remote/">LoRa Remote</a>.  The idea was to have a long range remote for future projects.  I didn't end up using it for much, but the build process taught me many things about how I wanted to document and share projects.</p><p>First, you'll notice that these earliest photos are actually on my walnut desktop and not on the white photo background.  Projects after this moved over to white backgrounds, and even the last photos in this series have the white backdrop.  </p><p>For now, you can see the simple part designed to house the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3102">Adafruit analog joystick</a>.  Analog means that the joystick isn't just a set of switches so that "up" on the joystick turns on one switch, or that "up" and "left" on the joystick turns on two switches, etc.  Instead with analog, each directional movement causes a change in resistance that can be read as a value. This means the board can read the difference to the joystick between pressing a little and alot. For the part below, you can see some simple radius cutouts for the electrical terminals.  The joystick didn't come with a mounting ring or any screw holes, so I needed to design a case to hold it in place.  The first part here is printed with a Prusa MK2 FDM printer.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/JAY01155.jpg" class="kg-image" alt

special because for the first time, I got all the dimensions correct on the first try.  After that, the simple lid was easy.  There's still no mounting holes on this enclosure, and the layer lines are a little messy, but that's OK- this is just a series of test prints.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/JAY01152.jpg" class="kg-image" alt

quickly jumped to the housing holding the trigger assembly.  This was a basic replacement trigger (for a leaf blower I think) off Amazon.  What little I did document is listed here on the project page.</p><p>One thing I played with was using different part orientations- you can see the joystick enclosure is printed one way, but the rest of the case is printed at a 90 degree angle, with the two parts screwed together.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/JAY01157.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1334"

idea of mixing black and white together, as well as a raised print area to act as an indentation for the lock switch- I didn't like the layer lines from the supports, so that design idea didn't last long.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/JAY01160.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1334"

some of the test prints laid out- I didn't have the screw holes to connect the joystick, but I did continue to play with the shape of the enclosure.  I did get a resin printer, so these were some of the last FDM prints I did for this project.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/JAY01169.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000"

test print that actually printed the entire enclosure as a single part.  Although it's widely known now, back in 2019 I didn't know that resin printers had issues with geometric and straight lines.  As a result, this print came out a little warped.  I ended up going back to the two-part design, but a couple countersunk metric screws held the project together just fine.</p><figure class="kg-card

resin, you can see the two metric screws fitted into place, making sure they didn't interfere with the joystick.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img

2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As I started to focus on the electronics, I realized I would need space for wiring from the Adafruit Feather.  You can see the white FDM part as a spacer below.  In this design, the Feather is on the opposite side from the trigger.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/JAY01178.jpg"

keep it as thin as possible, I soldered wire directly to the board.  Since the board doesn't have any components on the bottom, I now know I could have soldered the wires the other way to save a little more space.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/JAY01213.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1334"
