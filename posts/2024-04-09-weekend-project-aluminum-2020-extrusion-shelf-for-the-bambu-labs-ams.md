<p>I've been really happy with my Bambu Labs X1C, and I will admit I was a little skeptical since Bambu sent so many "review units" to all the 3D printing influencers.  Many times unless they say they return it, you should know they usually get to keep the stuff.  I tried a single Bambu X1C, and now have a second to help print stuff faster- and the AMS units have been amazing.  </p><p>Anyway, I am adding a second AMS to each printer and didn't like the shelf options out there, specifically because my setup needs to fit under a cabinet.  There are many custom plywood options too- and if cost is your main concern, I have to admit wood is going to be a better option.  Hopefully my poor reasoning makes for a fun read!</p><p>I wanted my AMS units to slide out on drawers, and it should be noted now: <strong><em>THIS BUILD MUST BE ANCHORED TO THE COUNTER OR WALL- EVEN FULLY LOADED, EITHER TRAY EXTENDS ENOUGH TO TIP!  TIPPING DRAWERS HURT LOTS OF KIDS EACH YEAR, SO SECURE YOUR SETUP!</em></strong></p><p>There, with that warning lets talk about the build.  I wanted to demonstrate a build that could be done with only materials from Amazon or similar, and <u>no cutting</u>.  That means this build uses 400mm 2020 extrusion on all sides.  It could be a little shorter and more shallow, but the shallow depth would make it tip even easier than it does.  Anchor that shelf!</p><p>From there, it's pretty straightforward - I modified <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/206294?from=search#profileId-235855" rel="noreferrer">"Placeholder's" AMS tray design</a> that is quite good- but oof, that front handle design means that support material <u>doubles</u> the print time.  I made my own handle here. I don't think I have the fillet quite matched to Placeholder's, but this is meant to be mostly functional.  I went with an asymmetric handle for my build.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00263.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" srcset="/images/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00263.jpg 600w, /images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00263.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My handle design requires no supports, and it rounds out the build quite nicely since the other original parts from Placeholder didn't either.  I did add some adapter brackets that go from the shelf to the 2020- here's a peek at one installed:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00259.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" srcset="/images/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00259.jpg 600w, /images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00259.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>They are mirrored from left to right, and inverted for the top shelf, so it's just two part designs for the side brackets.  If you were mounting the rails to wood or similar, you probably would not need these parts, but they are pretty great for non-destructive builds.  I was even able to pop out the heat set inserts and re-use them on a different side rail.</p><p>Here's the parts list, aside from the AMS units themselves, everything else was McMaster Carr or Amazon:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>M4 Threaded Inserts - M4x4.7mm depth. I used McMaster Carr Stainless (<a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/130/3775/97163A152">https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/130/3775/97163A152</a>) but you can use Amazon but be careful to use ones that fit in the depth like the McMaster ones.  The shallow ones here might be a good fit (<a href="https://amzn.to/3PTfV2Z">https://amzn.to/3PTfV2Z</a>).</p>

<p>It's worth noting that as a builder I had many of these screws on hand already, and if you buy all the parts in this list you will have some leftovers- small plastic food bins or industrial plastic bags are good for storing extras- just make sure to label them!</p><p>Finally, thank you to all my paid supporters- you all fund these projects to help me share- the files for this are creative commons since the original design from Placeholder was that license- check out <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/206294?from=search#profileId-235855" rel="noreferrer">their design here</a>, and check out <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/420671" rel="noreferrer">my remix here</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00254-1.jpg" width="857" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="/images/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00254-1.jpg 600w, /images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00254-1.jpg 857w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00257.jpg" width="789" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="/images/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00257.jpg 600w, /images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00257.jpg 789w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00258.jpg" width="784" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="/images/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00258.jpg 600w, /images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00258.jpg 784w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00259-1.jpg" width="1000" height="667" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="/images/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00259-1.jpg 600w, /images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00259-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00260.jpg" width="1000" height="891" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="/images/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00260.jpg 600w, /images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00260.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00261.jpg" width="1000" height="788" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="/images/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00261.jpg 600w, /images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00261.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00263-1.jpg" width="1000" height="667" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="/images/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/JAY00263-1.jpg 600w, /images/content/images/2024/04/JAY00263-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure>
