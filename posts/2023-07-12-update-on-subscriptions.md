<p>As I re-launch back7.co as doscher.com, I want to highlight the move to focus on subscriptions.  I think we all can understand that social media platforms are increasingly focusing on ads and decreasing income to creators.  My move to subscriptions has 3 tiers:</p><ul><li>Email/Free subscriptions are ideal for most people- you can also subscribe to the site via RSS too- but understand I won't ever sell or share your email, and it will only be used for projects (this post doesn't even go out via email).</li><li>$3/month gets you a ton of info!  I will be uploading a bunch of new posts in the coming weeks for $3 subscriptions that has photos and details around past projects.</li><li>$20 may be going up, but is designed to give you a chance to ask me directly for info on projects.  This tier will be designed if you want a greater influence on projects or a chance to make requests.</li></ul><p>I have a basic analytics suite from <a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/PBXHCV">Fathom Analytics</a>, which gives me very simple but easy to read info like pageviews, country location (not even state or city).  Your handy adblocker can filter you if needed, but I don't have any ads or Google analytics on this site.  The site and design files will remain free, and I thank you for your support!</p><p>-Jay</p>
