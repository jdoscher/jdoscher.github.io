<p>Here's another quick post as I work through some utility prints here in the office.  I <a href="__GHOST_URL__/3d-printed-brackets-for-the-level-1-techs-4x-pc-2x-monitor-kvm/" rel="noreferrer">previously posted</a> a cage chassis for my newer <a href="https://www.store.level1techs.com/products/p/14-display-port-kvm-dual-4computer-kllrb-mfj5x" rel="noreferrer">4 PC, 2 Monitor KVM switch</a>.  I have repurposed my <a href="https://www.store.level1techs.com/products/p/14-kvm-switch-dual-monitor-2computer-z5erd-n6mbj" rel="noreferrer">older 2 PC version</a> on the second workbench.  I wanted a cage chassis for that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch" rel="noreferrer">KVM</a> too, so here it is!  This one is far simpler, but also significantly more rigid.  You can check the <a href="https://doscher.com/patrons-only-2xpc-kvm-switch-design-files" rel="noreferrer">member's post here for the STL files</a>, or check out the series of KVM's from Level1Techs (<em>not sponsored, just a fan</em>).</p><p>Thank you to all my patrons who help support my builds!  This one is pretty simple, but is really designed to be very functional while keeping the cyberpunk/retro-futuristic visuals I enjoy so much.  Would you all like to see what the workshop looks like?  Let me know and I can write something up after I clear off all the coffee cups.  Time for the build!</p><p>The premise is simple, a "cage" for the KVM switch that allows for easy access to ports as well as holes for mounting to a desk.  There are some cross-brace elements to this frame to help keep it very rigid- we don't want this flexing too much.  I'm again using the Bambu Carbon Fiber PETG- mostly because the matte finish is amazing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/Level1Techs-2PC-KVM-Brackets-MOVIE-v1-640-2.gif" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/Level1Techs-2PC-KVM-Brackets-MOVIE-v1-640-2.gif 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/Level1Techs-2PC-KVM-Brackets-MOVIE-v1-640-2.gif 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>All sides are assembled using M4x10mm socket head screws.  I decided to mount the KVM "upside down" so the ports face upwards.  This is a build designed to randomly connect monitors and cables easily from the desk as needed- it's not a full time KVM since it's not my primary desk.  There are 5 holes along the top of the back (that faces the desk) as well as 5 holes along the bottom of that same side for using a 1/4" or similar sized screw.  You could use drywall screws in a pinch, but they may be too brittle.</p><p>Thanks for following along on this build!  I will continue to share these smaller projects throughout the year.  Thank you again for all your support!</p>
