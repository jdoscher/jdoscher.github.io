<p>When I started making the original Recovery Kit (and admittedly the Recovery Kit 2) I went for the coolest parts and features that I thought fit with the projects.  As some of you realize, that also means the build of materials can exceed the cost of a new, boring laptop.  A few years back I went about making the simplest possible kit for a Raspberry Pi and created the Quick Kit.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/01/JAY00468.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/JAY00468.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/JAY00468.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/JAY00468.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/01/JAY00468.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I still really like the Quick Kit, and still have a couple of them here in the lab, however I am not romantic about them.  Despite it showing its age, even the original Recovery Kit is for sale (email me).  With the more recent Quick Kit design last year, I simplified the part that needs 3D printing to a single frame, inserted into a <a href="https://amzn.to/4jeHKQj" rel="noreferrer">Pelican 1150</a> case.  I like Pelican cases, they are strong, durable, and for the most part the colors work with my designs.  They are also made here in the US (Los Angeles) and I think that's cool.  It's part of why I've never offered a design for "cheaper" cases like the Harbor Freight ones.  I've often seen cheeky references to how inexpensive their stuff is, and from what I understand about their design approach, I am not a fan.  You will not see a design from me using those cases.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Pelican cases have gotten really expensive recently, as have many other things.  Cases that were once $35 are now $55, and the ones that were once $50 here in the US are close to double that outside the US.  Given that my subscribers are just as likely to be inside the US as abroad, I wanted to see if I could make a case.  The first thing I tried was a simple shell and lid similar to the components in a typical waterproof case, and this led to a ton of supports, and a risky all-or-nothing print that could take days.  Yes, days.  Instead, I figured I could take a page from woodworking and use panels, just like people have been making wood boxes for a while now.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/01/JAY00465.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/JAY00465.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/JAY00465.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/JAY00465.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/01/JAY00465.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The panels are simple, I am using pressure-fit M3 holes scaled down to 2.8mm to allow friction to bind the screws. The project uses just a bag of M3x8mm socket screws along with some M3x12mm flat head screws.  While you can just drop in an existing Quick Kit project into this case, you need a little better friction fit, so there are M3 holes on the side of this new case to mount the Quick Kit frame.  You can drill 4 small holes at around 2mm to mount the Quick Kit frame, using the mounting part from the new Quick Kit Case as a jig to spot the holes.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/01/JAY00464.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/JAY00464.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/JAY00464.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/JAY00464.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/01/JAY00464.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Each panel has an orientation designed to print flat on a Bambu X1C or similar printer- although it might be possible to chop up the design for a smaller mini printer, that's a challenge for another day.  All in all it takes about a single 1KG spool to make this case, and I used non-Bambu <a href="https://amzn.to/4gQFxci" rel="noreferrer">Overture Matte PLA</a> at around $18 for the spool.  I wanted to make sure there was no Bambu-only lock in here, although one of my test spools of the Overture got a little bound once the cardboard spool got a little bent.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/01/JAY00471.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/01/JAY00471.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/01/JAY00471.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2025/01/JAY00471.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/01/JAY00471.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Finally there are some neat things I did with this case that are either inconvenient, impossible, or expensive with the original commercial case:</p><ul>
<li>I made a vented top that I am really happy with.  This easily solves the waste heat issue that the NVME Quick Kit generates with a Raspberry Pi 5 and two NVME drives running.  I am still on the hunt for a reasonably priced panel mount USB C connector that can handle the current from this setup.</li>
<li>Once I do find a new panel mount, I don't have to print the whole thing again- some of these panels (like the side panels) only take about 45 minutes to print.  While PLA will wear out pretty quickly with constant re-assembly, the convenience here is pretty great.</li>
<li>I had a chance to lower my standards again!  Seriously though, if you don't really <em>need</em> a waterproof case, this is an awesome option for a desk or a decoration of an otherwise ungainly Pi setup in your space.  If I wanted to, 4 screws removed let me drop this in a Pelican case and get on my way.</li>
<li>More control over the aesthetics.  I love sci-fi just a bit more than tacticool, so it's fun showing something that just may one day iterate to look like a sci-fi prop.</li>
<li>Accessibility really needs to be mentioned one last time- this means that if you're reading this, the files are free!  You do need a 3D printer, and you do need it dialed in.</li>
