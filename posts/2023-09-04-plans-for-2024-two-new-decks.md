<p>I'm continuing to build out my setup to provide new projects, and I can't do it without you- the paid subscribers.  New tiers and benefits will be added over time, but the first will be coming this Fall- a new unibody Quick Kit design.  Any existing paid subscriber at the $30/year tier will get one, and anyone at the highest elite tier can request mods like specific ports or spacing changes.</p><p>In addition the new store will open by December, offering kits and instructions for assembly- parts and shipping are simply too expensive, and I am happy to write build instructions for you to make your own.</p><p>Finally, what I suspect you all are reading for- two new deck designs.  I have challenged myself to one-up the original Recovery Kit, making it better in every way.  Some items are easy, like better connectors and switches.  Some are hard- like the labor intensive soldering that make them so expensive to build for other people.</p><p>There's also a new larger variant, with the photo of the case below:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/images/content/images/2023/09/DSC00005.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" srcset="/images/content/images/2023/09/DSC00005.jpg 600w, /images/content/images/2023/09/DSC00005.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Eagle eyed viewers will notice the tool pouch in the lid- that's a weight because this case orientation doesn't lay open without tipping over.  Literally anything and everything is on the table for this one, and I am still collecting ideas and playing with some parts.  It's definitely too big for my 3D printers, so I'll need to get creative on how to address- whether laser cut, anodized, or just a jigsaw of parts to make it all work.</p><p>I did mention two kits, the second is the refresh of the Recovery Kit.  It's time for a better chassis, but the concept is still solid.  There's better hardware out there too!  More to come.</p><p>Finally, feel free to comment and ask questions!  Only subscribers can post comments, and only paid subscribers see these updates.  Thank you again for your continued support!</p>
