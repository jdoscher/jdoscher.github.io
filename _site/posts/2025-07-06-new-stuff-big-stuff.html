  <h1>New stuff.  Big Stuff.</h1>
  <p><small>July 06, 2025</small></p>
  <p>Hi folks, just a quick update on progress as I've been busy behind the scenes.  Here's what we have coming up:</p>
<hr />
<p>There will be the new case-less design that's coming out in the next few weeks, and it's a 100% printable Raspberry Pi 5 case.  It's a small update based on some older Pelican 1150 case work, but is a fun project if you already have a Pi5 (or Pi4) and a Pelican 1150 hanging around.  The case is of course optional!  Keep an eye out for this in July.  As always, the design files will be free, and the paid subscriptions help!</p>
<hr />
<p>We have a new product newsletter launching to go with our "Big Stuff" announcement, that will be towards the end of July.  These will be full commercial products, and much larger than anything you've seen me do to date.  I'll also be adding existing prints to the new store when it launches.</p>
<p><em>You can sign up for that newsletter by clicking on your </em><a href="__GHOST_URL__/#/portal/account" rel="noreferrer"><em>account button</em></a><em> on the main homepage.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I'm adding a second newsletter for code projects.  These will be on my Github here, but you can also sign up to get an article for each project.  These projects start in about a week, and I expect to do a new one every couple weeks this year.  As always no ads, just some small code snippets.  You can create an account if you're new, or click <a href="__GHOST_URL__/#/portal/account" rel="noreferrer">Account</a> in the upper right hand corner of the website.</p>
<hr />
<p>Finally, I still have the early phases of the Recovery Kit 3 in the works, but as we all have felt the pinch, development has slowed a bit.  I want to say thank you to the supporters hanging in there with me, I am working to make the RK3 easier than ever to assemble and use.  </p>
